# Number Clicker
## Deployed at www.numberclicker.com

## How it works
This is a simple game where your objective is to place random numbers in ascending order. 
Fill in all 10 number slots and you win! A new random number between 1-100 (inclusive) will be rolled each time you place a number.
If you run out of available spots to place the new random number, you lose :(

## How it was built
This project was made in React with TypeScript using MUI for basic components. I use Vite for building the project and Firebase to host with automated CI/CD scripts using GitHub Actions.
